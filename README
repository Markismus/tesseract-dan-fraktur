Various training data files for Tesseract OCR (version 3.00+)

* dan-frak/: Danish written in fraktur script (orthography prior to ca. 1867).
* deu-frak/: German written in fraktur script.
* swe-frak/: Swedish written in fraktur script. The wordlists for Swedish are from 
Projekt Runeberg, http://runeberg.org/words/
* dan/: slightly manipulated version of the Danish .traineddata shipped with upstream tesseract
to not output annoying fi- and fl-ligatures all the time. Since tesseract version 3.02, this 
has become outdated. If you have this, it is a better solution to upgrade tesseract.

The *-frak/ directories have a primitive script to compile the data files that only works on
unix-like machines. If you aren't interested in working on training tesseract yourself, just
find the *.traineddata that is relevant for your language, save it to your tesseract
installation's data directory and you should be ready for ocr.
